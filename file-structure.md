Key Features
------------

1.  **Custom Post Type (**`**smart_form**`**)**:

    -   Stores form configurations and settings in post meta as structured JSON.

    -   Hidden from the default admin menu to consolidate plugin-related functionality.

2.  **Block Editor Integration**:

    -   The Gutenberg block editor is embedded directly into the plugin's custom "Create Form" admin page.

    -   Custom blocks allow site owners to build forms step-by-step, defining fields like buttons, dropdowns, and text inputs.

3.  **Dynamic Frontend Display**:

    -   Forms are rendered dynamically on the frontend using AJAX for seamless user interactions.

    -   Tailwind CSS provides professional, modern styling without requiring extensive custom CSS.

4.  **GPT-Powered Responses**:

    -   User inputs are processed by OpenAI's GPT API to generate intelligent, chatbot-style recommendations or responses.

5.  **Unified Admin Interface**:

    -   All plugin functionality (form creation, settings, etc.) is accessible via a single "SmartForms" menu in the admin area.

    -   This ensures a cohesive user experience and avoids conflicts with other plugins.

Flow and Architecture
---------------------

### Admin Area

1.  **Custom Post Type**:

    -   The `smart_form` post type serves as the data store for forms but is hidden from the admin menu (`show_in_menu => false`).

    -   Forms are managed entirely through the plugin's custom admin pages.

2.  **Embedding the Block Editor**:

    -   The block editor is embedded into the "Create Form" admin page using the WordPress API.

    -   Blocks are provided for common form components (e.g., text fields, buttons, dropdowns), allowing site owners to configure forms easily.

### Frontend

1.  **Rendering Forms**:

    -   Forms are dynamically rendered on the frontend based on the JSON configurations stored in the backend.

    -   User interactions are handled via AJAX to load steps or send inputs without page reloads.

2.  **Styling with Tailwind CSS**:

    -   Tailwind CSS ensures forms and chat interfaces are styled professionally, with minimal custom CSS for maintainability.

3.  **GPT Integration**:

    -   User inputs are sent to OpenAI's GPT API for processing.

    -   Responses are displayed dynamically as part of the chat flow.

Development Notes
-----------------

1.  **Modularity**:

    -   The plugin is designed with a modular structure, separating backend logic, assets, blocks, and templates for maintainability.

2.  **Scalability**:

    -   The architecture supports future extensions, such as new block types or integrations.

3.  **Adherence to Standards**:

    -   Uses WordPress best practices, including the REST API, block editor, and action/filter hooks.
