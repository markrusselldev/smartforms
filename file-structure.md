SmartForms Project Structure
============================

Overview
--------

SmartForms is an **AI-powered questionnaire tool** that dynamically adjusts based on user input. It is built as a Gutenberg-based system with multi-step forms, allowing users to receive intelligent recommendations powered by AI. This structure ensures flexibility, scalability, and proper integration with WordPress best practices.

Block Architecture
------------------

### **1\. Form Block (`src/form/` - Parent Block)**

-   **Purpose:** Acts as the **main container** for AI-powered questionnaires.
-   **Stores global settings:** Form title, submission method, AI settings, validation rules.
-   **Handles navigation & AI logic:** Progress tracking, next/back buttons, API calls to AI models.
-   **Uses InnerBlocks** to hold Step blocks.

### **2\. Step Block (`src/step/` - Child Block)**

-   **Purpose:** Represents a single "page" in an AI-driven multi-step questionnaire.
-   **Contains:** Fields inside `InnerBlocks`, dynamically adjusted by AI.
-   **Navigation:** Has Next & Back buttons, with AI logic to determine the next step dynamically.

### **3\. Field Blocks (`src/fields/` - Grandchild Blocks)**

-   **Purpose:** Individual form inputs (Text, Checkbox, Select, etc.) that interact with AI.
-   **Each field has:**
    -   `edit.js`: Defines block settings & UI controls.
    -   `index.js`: Registers the block in Gutenberg.
    -   `style.scss`: Default styling.
    -   AI hooks to process user input dynamically.

Development Plan
----------------

1.  **Implement the Form (Parent) block with AI interaction**
2.  **Implement the Step block with AI-driven adjustments**
3.  **Convert form fields into independent AI-interactive blocks**
4.  **Implement AI-driven conditional logic (show/hide fields & steps dynamically based on AI responses)**
5.  **Style & refine the UI, ensuring a chat-like experience**

This structure ensures a clean, maintainable, and WordPress-native AI-powered questionnaire experience. ðŸš€
